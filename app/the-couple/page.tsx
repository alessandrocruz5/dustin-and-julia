                dustin and julia&apos;s love story began serving side by side in
                youth ministry at church. what started as good friends quickly
                blossomed into a deep connection rooted in their mutual love for
                the next generation and the Lord. as they spent time in the same
                circle of friends, dustin found himself drawn to julia&apos;s
                lively energy, a perfect contrast to his quiet and introverted
                nature.

                heritage, and the people who have supported them along the way.
                their wedding is a reflection of their heartsâ€”intimate,
                authentic, and joyfully candid. surrounded by loved ones, they
                aim to cherish this moment as a testimony to the love they share
                and the faith that brought them together.
